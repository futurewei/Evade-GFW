First of all, I really love this project. The hardest part is all about the network settings. 1. we cannot run on local machine. 2. when we run on virtual machine, the issue of NAT and Bridge is very gross. RST packet got blocked after first arrival. Outis is awesome for suggesting AWS cloud, but cloud also has a tiny issue for me. On VM, it’s easy to tell how many hops away is firewall, but on cloud, since NONE comes first, I got lost. In the future, please make sure VM is working for everybody, others are not hard. It’s better to include maybe one more sub questions about discovery of great cannon?
