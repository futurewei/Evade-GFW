What is the TTL of the real replies from the server: 
229
What is the TTL of the injected packets from the Great Firewall:  
223

How many RST packets did the Great Firewall inject:  
Great Firewall injects 3 RST packets.
The main reason for this is because Great Firewall cannot stop message sent to server, so it has to send 3 RST to make sure it can disconnect senderâ€™s communication before server responses arrives.
