Describe (in 2-3 paragraphs) your evasion strategy:

	I break my request into word, and send the entire request character by character to evade. There’s no RST because the one character request doesn’t appear to be a bad request to Firewall, so it let it pass and go to server. 
	When every character of my original request arrived at the Server, server concatenate them together. If there’s desired data, server would send back a  200 ok message otherwise return a 404 for Page not found. Things to pay attention is that 1. every time we need to send two copies of the one character request with one of them set a TTL longer enough to reach server the other with a TTL longer enough to pass firewall but die before server.[this serves to fool the Firewall]  Also, we can only do “PA” tag for last fragment of data request because “PA” is a force processing tag we have to wait until all pieces arrive. One more thing important is to increment our seq number by 1 for every char we sent!
